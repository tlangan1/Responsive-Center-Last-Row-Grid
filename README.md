# Center Last Row of Grid in a Responsive Manner

1. The `span` solution works by creating the factorial of the column count columns and then spanning across those columns to achieve an aesthetically balanced presentation.
2. The `two grid` solution works by moving the last row of the main grid to the overflow grid if the last row of the main grid is not full. Unlike the `span` solution this solution is scalable but it may have some accessability issues.
